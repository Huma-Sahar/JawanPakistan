// write a function which returns array. call the function and destructure array values and print the value

// Make a car object with model, year, color. display all the values by destructuring

// use three variable name, greeting and display value using template literals

// use array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] assign first three values in seperate variables and all remaining in one element as an array

// if car speed is less than 80 display "car speed is slow", if greater than 80 but less than 120 than display
